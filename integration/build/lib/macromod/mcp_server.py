            CGG (real government consumption), TCPRO (corporation tax main rate),
            CGIPS (nominal central government investment).
        shock: Shock size, applied each quarter. UNITS DEPEND ON THE VARIABLE:
            CGG and CGIPS are in £ million per quarter (e.g. 1250 = £5bn/year);
            TCPRO is a rate change in decimal (e.g. -0.05 = 5 percentage point cut).

        investment_closure: Set True for corporation tax (TCPRO) shocks — it
            activates the cost-of-capital investment channel; without it TCPRO
            shocks have no effect on business investment.

    Returns per-period rows (period, delta_gdp_bn, pct_gdp, delta_cons_m,
