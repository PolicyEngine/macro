"""Deploy the PolicyEngine Macro MCP server to Modal over streamable HTTP.

    modal deploy integration/modal_app.py

Serves the FastMCP instance from `policyengine_macro.mcp_server` (18 tools:
list_model_capabilities, get_model_status, recommend_model,
format_score_report, score_reform, obr_shock, list_reform_variables, frbus_shock,
frbus_list_variables, frbus_summary, forecast_uk, latest_shocks, model_summary,
calculate_household, household_reform_impact, list_reform_parameters,
population_reform_impact, dynamic_reform_impact — the last returns an
actionable "run locally" error here, because oguk is excluded from this
image; see below) as an
ASGI app at  https://policyengine--policyengine-macro-mcp-serve.modal.run/mcp

All three model repos resolve their data files relative to their own repo root
(`Path(__file__)`-relative); `policyengine_macro.core`'s svar_summary falls back to a
checkout via POLICYENGINE_MACRO_BOE_VAR_REPO only when boe_var is absent (it is
installed here, so the fallback never fires), and _frbus_repo() falls back to
POLICYENGINE_MACRO_FRB_REPO likewise. We bake the repos into the
image at the SAME absolute paths and `pip install -e` them, so every path
resolves in the container with zero patching:
  - obr_macro:  /Users/janansadeqian/obr-macroeconomic-model  (+ data/)
  - boe_var:    /Users/janansadeqian/boe-var-model            (+ data/, results/)
  - frbus:      /Users/janansadeqian/us-frb-model             (+ vendor/, pruned)

COST PROFILE
------------
- min_containers=0  -> scales to zero: $0/hr while idle (no keep_warm).
- scaledown_window=300 -> container stays warm 5 min after the last request,
  so a chat session doesn't pay a cold start on every tool call, then sleeps.
- cpu=4, memory=8192 MiB -> ~$0.00023/s while running (4 physical cores +
  8GiB). Raised from 2/2048 for population_reform_impact: a UK population
  run measured ~1.8GB peak RSS on a laptop, so 8GiB gives 2 concurrent
  population runs headroom; 4 CPUs also cut OBR/SVAR latency. A population
  score (~10-40s warm) costs order $0.002-0.01; a default forecast
  (draws=500) similar; summary/list calls are sub-cent noise. Idle cost is
  exactly $0.
- max_containers=3 -> hard spend cap against abuse/fan-out.
- timeout=600 -> allows high-draw forecasts (e.g. draws=6000) and the
  first-ever population data download (~125MB + dataset build) to finish.

FRB/US (frbus_shock) COST AND RESOURCES
---------------------------------------
FRB/US is by far the CHEAPEST macro member here, and needed no change to
cpu/memory/timeout:
- Latency, measured on a laptop for the default 20-quarter window: ~0.1s to
  read LONGBASE, ~0.7s to parse model.xml and symbolically differentiate the
  284 equations into an analytic sparse Jacobian, ~2.3s for init_trac, and
  ~0.2-0.5s per solve (~4.4ms per quarter). A COLD frbus_shock call is
  therefore ~3s end to end. core._FRBUS_BASELINE_CACHE holds the compiled
  model and its add-factored baseline per (policy_rule, start, end), so every
  WARM call in the same container is just the shocked solve: ~0.3s.
  frbus_list_variables and frbus_summary are static and instant.
- Against the 600s timeout that is ~200x headroom. Even a 100-year window
  would land near 18s.
- Memory: the model state is a single ~860-column DataFrame over a quarterly
  index plus the sparse Jacobian — tens of MB, an order of magnitude under
  the population microsim's ~1.8GB peak that actually sizes this container.
  The cache holds one such baseline per policy rule (3 rules max).
- CPU: the solve is a scipy sparse LU on 284 equations and is effectively
  single-threaded; it does not benefit from cpu=4 the way the OBR/SVAR runs
  do, but it does not contend for it either.
- Image cost: the repo is 251MB on disk but only LONGBASE.TXT (4.4MB) and
  model.xml (533KB) are needed at runtime, so _FRB_IGNORE / _FRB_PRUNE cut it
  to ~5MB in the image (see the comment on those constants).

WHY FRB/US IS HOSTABLE AND OG-UK IS NOT
---------------------------------------
The distinction is not model size, it is what a single call has to compute.
FRB/US here uses VAR (backward-looking) expectations, so each quarter is one
Newton solve on a 284-equation system with a precomputed analytic Jacobian and
NO iteration over the future: cost is linear in the horizon at ~4.4ms per
quarter, and the data it needs is a 4.5MB text file that ships in the image.
OG-UK has to find a general-equilibrium STEADY STATE — a fixed point over the
whole lifecycle distribution — per scenario, measured at >17 minutes for one
baseline solve, two solves per reform score, plus a PolicyEngine microdata
calibration step. One is a bounded linear-time simulation, the other is an
unbounded nested fixed-point search; only the first fits a 600s request.

POPULATION DATA (population_reform_impact)
------------------------------------------
- Secret "macromod-hf" provides HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN for the private UK
  enhanced-FRS microdata on HuggingFace. The name predates the
  PolicyEngine Macro rename and is kept because Modal has no rename for
  Secrets: changing it means recreating the Secret with the token value.
- A modal.Volume ("policyengine-macro-pe-data") is mounted at
  /root/.cache/policyengine-macro;
  HF_HOME points the HuggingFace download cache inside it and
  POLICYENGINE_MACRO_PE_DATA_DIR puts the derived per-year .h5 files (~92MB/year)
  there too, so the ~125MB download + dataset build happens once and
  persists across containers.

OG-UK (oguk) IS DELIBERATELY NOT IN THIS IMAGE
----------------------------------------------
The OG-UK steady-state adapters (score_reform model='og' / og-score CLI) need a
PolicyEngine microdata calibration plus an OG-Core steady-state solve per
scenario: measured >17 minutes for ONE baseline solve at defaults on a laptop,
and a reform score needs two solves. That cannot fit the 600s Modal timeout
with any headroom, so oguk is excluded here; the score_reform MCP tool with
model='og' will return an ImportError on the hosted server. Use the local CLI
(`pe-macro score --model og`) or a local MCP server instead. If it is ever added,
`pip install git+https://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-UK` works (hatchling build;
heavy deps: ogcore, policyengine-uk==2.88.0), but calibration also downloads
the enhanced FRS dataset (HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN) and UN demographics at runtime.
