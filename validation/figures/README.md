# validation/figures

Generating script for the four inline SVG charts on `/validation/`, in the same
spirit as the papers' `papers/*/figures/*.py` scripts.

## Regenerate

```sh
python3 validation/figures/make_charts.py
```

This rewrites the four `<svg class="vchart">` blocks in `validation/index.html`
in place. Stdlib only — no dependencies. To assert in CI that the page has not
drifted from its sources:

```sh
python3 validation/figures/make_charts.py --check   # exits 1 if stale
```

## Why hand-emitted SVG rather than matplotlib

The rest of the project renders figures with matplotlib, but these four have two
constraints the papers' figures do not:

1. **They must stay inline in the HTML.** The site ships no third-party JS and no
   external assets; a `.svg` or `.png` file next to the page would be a new
   external request.
2. **They must retheme for light/dark.** Every fill and stroke is a `vc-*` class
   defined in `style.css`, which resolves the site's CSS custom properties. A
   matplotlib export bakes in literal colour values and would need to be
   post-processed to strip them on every regeneration.

Emitting the markup directly satisfies both and keeps the script small enough to
audit line by line, which is the point of the page.

## Where the numbers come from

| Chart (`data-chart`) | Plots | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `obr-anchored` | Quarterly % deviation of the anchored emulator from the Nov-2025 EFO, 2025Q1–2027Q4, for real GDP and consumption | Computed from `papers/obr-macro/figures/fig_anchored_data.csv` (`*_model` vs `*_efo` levels) |
| `obr-reform` | 1pp basic-rate rise: PolicyEngine static costing vs HMRC ready reckoner, 2026–27 and 2028–29 | `chart_data.json` → `papers/obr-macro/sections/comparison.tex`, table `tab:comparison` panel B |
| `svar-fevd` | Global-shock FEVD shares at the 1-year horizon, ours vs the paper, for UK GDP and CPI | `papers/boe-svar/figures/comparison_numbers.json` |
| `frbus-residuals` | Max absolute residuals against the Fed's `pyfrbus`, log scale | `chart_data.json` → `papers/frb-us/sections/validation.tex`, tables `tab:tracking` and `tab:refnoise` |

Two charts read committed machine-readable data directly. The other two plot
numbers that exist in the project only as LaTeX table cells; those are
transcribed into `chart_data.json` with a per-value source pointer. **Do not edit
a value in `chart_data.json` without changing the cited source** — the file is a
transcription, not an input.

Deriving `obr-anchored`'s deviations from the CSV rather than transcribing them
also gives a free cross-check: the computed values reproduce the four selected
quarters in the paper's comparison table (+0.05%, −0.16%, +0.19%, +0.32% on GDP)
and the MAPEs quoted in the page prose (0.18% GDP, 0.29% consumption).

## Accessibility

Each chart carries `role="img"` and `aria-labelledby` pointing at a `<title>`
(short name) and a `<desc>` (the plotted values in prose, generated from the same
data as the marks, so it cannot drift). Inline SVG is otherwise invisible to
assistive tech.
